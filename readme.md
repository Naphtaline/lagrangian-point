# Lagrangian Point

This is a simple physics engine that I wrote in C++ during a game jam.

The engine itself has no dependency at all, but the demo is based on SFML. Cmake could locate the SFML library after you install it. And if you fail to run the demo, please check the output directory of the engine library and of graphics resources.

- Move by force
- Frame rate independent

## TODO

- Collision
- One-direction gravity
- ~~Make it easier to build it on other platforms~~
