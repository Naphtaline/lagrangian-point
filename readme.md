# Lagrangian Point

This is a simple physics engine that I wrote in C++ during a game jam.

The engine itself has no dependency at all. But the demo is based on SFML and only tested with Xcode. Cmake should be able to find the SFML library after you install it. If you can compile but failed to run the demo, please copy resources to the working directory.
